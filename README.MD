# Raja Chor Mantri Sipahi

A simple Python implementation of the traditional role-playing game "Raja Chor Mantri Sipahi" (King, Minister, Thief, Police).

We used to play this game when I was a child. I remember it was a lot of fun.

This project is designed for learning Game Development in Python.

This is a Phase 1 of the game.

## Roles & Points
- **Raja** (King): 1000 Points
- **Mantri** (Minister): 800 Points
- **Sipahi** (Police): 500 Points
- **Chor** (Thief): 0 Points

## How to Play
1. The game assigns roles randomly.
2. **Sipahi** has to guess who the **Chor** is.
3. If Sipahi guesses correctly, they get 500 points.
4. If Sipahi guesses incorrectly, the Chor gets the Sipahi's points (500), and Sipahi gets 0!


## Installation

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jaygaha/raja-chor-mantri-sipahi.git
cd raja-chor-mantri-sipahi
```

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Future Next Steps

Here are some ideas to make the game even better:

- [ ] **Phase 2:** Smarter bot AI
- [ ] **Phase 3:** WebSocket server for multiplayer
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Web frontend interface
